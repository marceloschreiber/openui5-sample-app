# My take on openui5-sample-app

This is my fork of [OpenUI5 sample app](https://github.com/SAP/openui5) using [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling).

I made some modifications that align with the way I like to develop.

## Changes made

- [X] Use Yarn instead of npm.
- [X] Rename **master** branch to **main**.
